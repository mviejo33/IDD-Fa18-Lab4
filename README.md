# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Manuel Viejo*

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your vibration motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

The power wire is typically red. The ground wire is typically black or brown. The signal pin is typically yellow, orange or white.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The speed is controlled by the delay and could also be controlled by modifying how much we increase/decrease the pos variable.
The angle is controlled by the variable pos, which is the input for myservo.write(pos)

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

I did one video (at the end of the lab) to cover both D and E.

## Part E. Make it your own
